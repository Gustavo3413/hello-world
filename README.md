# hello-world

My name is Gustavo, I am an international student coming from Brazil. My expectations for web design are very high, since my goal is to migrate from the Business field to Web Design and Development field. I hope that with the assignments and in-class tasks we have to do, I will get the necessary knowledge to build a portfolio that is worth the employers attention.
